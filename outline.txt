    Italian saint and founder of the Francis of Assisican religious order. 
    Born into a wealthy family, he was a soldier and prisoner of war 
    before he experienced a conversion in his early 20s. He sold his property,
     gave the proceeds to the church, and began a life of poverty and devoutness. 
     He soon attracted followers, whom he sent to preach throughout Europe, 
     and in 1209 Innocent III gave approval for the Francis of Assisican order. 
     The Rule of St. Francis of Assisi stressed the need to imitate the life of Jesus. 
     In many ways a mystic, Francis of Assisi viewed all nature as a mirror of God, 
     calling all creatures his brothers and sisters. 
     In 1212 he allowed formation of an order for women, called the Poor Clares. 
     In 1219 he went to Egypt, preached to the sultan, and visited the holy places of Jerusalem. 
     In 1224, after a vision, he became the first person to receive the stigmata. 
     His influence helped restore popular faith in a church much corrupted by wealth and political aspirations.
