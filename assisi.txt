 Francis was the son of Pietro di Bernardone,
 a cloth merchant, and the lady Pica, who may have come from France. 
 At Francis’s birth, his father was away on a business trip to France, 
 and his mother had him baptized Giovanni. On his return, however, 
 Pietro changed the infant’s name to Francesco because of either his interest 
 in France or his wife’s background. Francis learned to read and write Latin at 
 the school near the church of San Giorgio, acquired some knowledge of French 
 language and literature, and was especially fond of the Provenƈal culture of the troubadours. 
 He liked to speak French (although he never did so perfectly) and even attempted to sing in the language. 
 His youth was most likely without serious moral lapses, and his exuberant love of life and a general spirit 
 of worldliness made him a recognized leader of the young men of the town.
