Francis of Assisi preached to townspeople—even though as a layperson he was without license to do so—
and he soon attracted followers. In 1209 he composed for his mendicant disciples, or friars, 
a simple rule (Regula primitiva, “Primitive Rule”) drawn from passages in the Bible: “To follow the 
teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps.” He then led the group of 12 disciples
 to Rome to seek the approval of Pope Innocent III, an important step that demonstrated Francis of Assisi’s recognition 
 of papal authority and saved his order from the fate of the Waldensians, who had been declared heretics in the 
 late 12th century. At first Innocent was hesitant, but, following a dream in which he saw Francis of Assisi holding up the
  church of San Giovanni in Laterano, he gave oral approbation to the Francis of Assisican rule of life. This event, 
  which according to tradition, occurred on April 16, 1210, marked the official founding of the Francis of Assisican order.
   The Friars Minor, or Lesser Brothers, as they came to be known, were street preachers with no possessions and 
   only the Porziuncola as a centre. They preached and worked first in Umbria and then, as their numbers grew rapidly,
    in the rest of Italy.
