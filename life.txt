In 1202 he took part in a war between Assisi and Perugia, 
was held prisoner for almost a year, and on his release fell seriously ill. 
After his recovery, he attempted to join the papal forces under Count Gentile 
against the emperor Frederick II in Apulia in late 1205. On his journey, however, 
he had a vision or dream that bade him return to Assisi and await the call to a new kind of knighthood. 
On his return, he dedicated himself to solitude and prayer so that he might know Godâ€™s will for him.
